\section{Block Ciphers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kirchoff's Law
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Security of algorithm is based on the secret key rather than the algorithm.
    \item Assume nothing about the secrecy of the algorithm
    \end{itemize}
\item Block Cipher Basics
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Block cipher: Plaintext $\rightarrow$ Ciphertext on a fixed N-bit size. 
    \item Symmetric Key cryptography; treat algorithm as a block box
    \end{itemize}
